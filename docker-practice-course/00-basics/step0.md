Docker is a containerization platform that packages your app and all its dependencies together in the form called a docker container to ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment.<br>
This environment might be a production or staging server. Docker pulls the dependencies needed for your application to run from the cloud and configures them automatically. You donâ€™t need to do any extra work. Cool Right?



## What is Docker Container

A container is something quite similar to a virtual machine, which can be used to **contain and execute all the software required to run a particular program or set of programs.**<br>
The container includes an operating system (typically some flavor of Linux) as base, plus any software installed on top of the OS that might be needed.<br>
This container can therefore be run as a self-contained virtual environment, which makes it a lot easier to reproduce the same analysis on any infrastructure that supports running the container, from your laptop to a cloud platform, without having to go through the pain of identifying and installing all the software
dependencies involved.<br>
You can even have multiple containers running on the same machine, so you can easily switch between different environments if you need to run programs that have incompatible system requirements.<br>
